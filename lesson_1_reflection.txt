How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    It helped me to figure out the changes made compared to the old version.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    The entire history tells who and when made what changes, which helps a
    programmer to keep track of the code changes of the file.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Pros: easily to understand the history. make one commit per logical change
    Cons: sometimes will forget to save

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    The files in Git are mostly code files and interrelated, while in Google Docs,
    the files are text files and more independent with each other.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    Use git log to see every mannual commit and use git diff to see the detailed
    change every commit made.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    If I made some changes that introduced a bug, I can use git checkout to go
    back to any time of older commit and reset all the files to fix the bug.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
